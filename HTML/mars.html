            <p class="content">Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the diameter of Earth and has the same amount of
                dry
                land. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons and weather, but its atmosphere
                is too
                thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but
                evidence
                for water now exists mainly in icy soil and thin clouds.</p>

            <ol class="content">
                <li>If the sun were as tall as a typical front door and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.
                </li>
                <li><b>Mars is the fourth planet</b> from the sun at a distance of about 228 million km (142 million
                    miles) or
                    1.52 AU.</li>
                <li>One day on Mars takes just a little over 24 hours (the time it takes for Mars to rotate or spin
                    once). Mars
                    makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.</li>
                <li>Mars is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mars' solid surface has been altered by
                    volcanoes, impacts, crustal movement, and atmospheric effects such as dust storms.</li>
                <li>Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and argon (Ar).
                </li>
                <li>Mars has two moons named Phobos and Deimos.</li>
                <li>There are no rings around Mars.</li>
                <li>More than 40 spacecraft have been launched for Mars, from flybys and orbiters to rovers and landers
                    that
                    touched surface of the Red Planet. The first true Mars mission success was Mariner 4 in 1965.</li>
                <li>At this time in the planet's history, Mars's surface cannot support life as we know it. A key
                    science goal
                    is determining Mars's past and future potential for life.</li>
                <li>Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian soil oxidize, or rust, causing
                    the soil
                    to look red.</li>
