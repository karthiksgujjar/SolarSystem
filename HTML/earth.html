Earth, our home planet, is the only planet in our solar system known to harbor life - life that is incredibly diverse. All the things we need to survive exist under a thin layer of atmosphere that separates us from the cold, airless void of space.

<FONT face="Century" color="red" size="5">
<ol>
<li>If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel.</li>
<li>Earth is the third planet from the sun at a distance of about 150 million km (93 million miles) or one AU.</li>
<li>One day on Earth takes 24 hours (this is the time it takes the Earth to rotate or spin once). Earth makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days.</li>
<li>Earth is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet, with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. What makes Earth different from the other terrestrial planets is that it is also an ocean planet: 70 percent of the Earth's surface is covered in oceans.</li>
<li>The Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78 percent nitrogen (N2), 21 percent oxygen (O2) and 1 percent other ingredients -- the perfect balance for us to breathe and live. Many planets have atmospheres, but only Earth's is breathable.</li>
<li>Earth has one moon. Another name for a moon is satellite.</li>
<li>Earth has no rings.</li>
<li>Many orbiting spacecraft study the Earth from above as a whole system and together aid in understanding our home planet.</li>
<li>Earth is the perfect place for life.</li>
<li>Earth's atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.</li>
