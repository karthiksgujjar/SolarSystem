            <p class="content">Earth, our home planet, is the only planet in our solar system known to harbor life -
                that
                is incredibly diverse. All the things we need to survive exist under a thin layer of atmosphere that
                separates usfrom the cold, airless void of space.</p>

            <p class="subHeading">10 Need-to-Know Things About the Earth</p>
            <ol class="content">
                <li>If the sun were as tall as a typical front door and Earth would be the size of a nickel.</li>
                <li><b>Earth is the third planet</b> from the sun at a distance of about 150 million km (93 million
                    miles) or
                    one AU.</li>
                <li>One day on Earth takes 24 hours (this is the time it takes the Earth to rotate or spin once). Earth
                    makes a
                    complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days.</li>
                <li>Earth is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet, with a solid and dynamic surface of
                    mountains,
                    valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. What makes Earth different from the other terrestrial
                    planets is
                    that it is also an ocean planet: 70 percent of the Earth's surface is covered in oceans.</li>
                <li>The Earth's atmosphere is made up of 78 percent nitrogen (N2), 21 percent oxygen (O2) and 1 percent
                    other
                    ingredients -- the perfect balance for us to breathe and live. Many planets have atmospheres, but
                    only
                    Earth's is breathable.</li>
                <li>Earth has one moon. Another name for a moon is satellite.</li>
                <li>Earth has no rings.</li>
                <li>Many orbiting spacecraft study the Earth from above as a whole system and together aid in
                    understanding our
                    home planet.</li>
                <li>Earth is the perfect place for life.</li>
                <li>Earth's atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere
                    before
                    they can strike the surface as meteorites.</li>
