            <p class="content">The most massive planet in our solar system - with dozens of moons and an enormous
                magnetic field
                - Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. It resembles a star in composition, but did not grow
                big
                enough to ignite. The planet's swirling cloud stripes are punctuated by massive storms such as the Great
                Red
                Spot, which has raged for hundreds of years.</p>

            <p class="subHeading">10 Need-to-Know Things About the Jupiter</p>
            <ol class="content">
                <li>If the sun were as tall as a typical front door and Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.
                </li>
                <li><b>Jupiter is the fifth planet</b> from the sun at a distance of about 778 million km (484 million
                    miles) or
                    5.2 AU.</li>
                <li>One day on Jupiter takes about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin once).
                    Jupiter
                    makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth
                    days).
                </li>
                <li>Jupiter is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface. However, it is predicted
                    that
                    Jupiter has an inner, solid core about the size of the Earth.</li>
                <li>Jupiter's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).</li>
                <li>Jupiter has 50 known moons, with an additional 17 moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery -
                    that is a
                    total of 67 moons.</li>
                <li>Jupiter has a faint ring system that was discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 mission.</li>
                <li>Many missions have visited Jupiter and its system of moons. The Juno mission will arrive at Jupiter
                    in 2016.
                </li>
                <li>Jupiter cannot support life as we know it. However, some of Jupiter's moons have oceans underneath
                    their
                    crusts that might support life.</li>
                <li>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm (bigger than Earth) that has been raging for hundreds
                    of years.
