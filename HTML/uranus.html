<span id="content">Uranus is the only giant planet whose equator is nearly at right angles to its orbit. A collision with an Earth-sized object may explain the unique tilt. Nearly a twin in size to Neptune, Uranus has more methane in its mainly hydrogen and helium atmosphere than Jupiter or Saturn. Methane gives Uranus its blue tint.</span> <br><br>

<ol>
<li>If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel and Uranus would be about as big as a baseball.</li>
<li>Uranus orbits our sun, a star. Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun at a distance of about 2.9 billion km (1.8 billion miles) or 19.19 AU.</li>
<li>One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours (the time it takes for Uranus to rotate or spin once). Uranus makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Uranian time) in about 84 Earth years.</li>
<li>Uranus is an ice giant. Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials  water (H2O), methane (CH4). and ammonia (NH3) above a small rocky core.</li>
<li>Uranus has an atmosphere which is mostly made up of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He), with a small amount of methane (CH4).</li>
<li>Uranus has 27 moons. Uranus' moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</li>
<li>Uranus has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark and the outer rings are brightly colored.</li>
<li>Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus.</li>
<li>Uranus cannot support life as we know it.</li>
<li>Like Venus, Uranus has a retrograde rotation (east to west). Unlike any of the other planets, Uranus rotates on its side, which means it spins horizontally.</li>
