The 'Solar System' was formed from a cloud of space dust and gas that was 'squeezed' by a supernova explosion: Big Bang theory. <br>
As the nebula contracted, it spun increasingly rapidly, leading to frequent collisions between dust grains. Gravity pulled the gas and dust together, forming a solar nebula. This solar nebula grew hotter and denser, forming a disk of gas and dust in its centre. Particles of nebula dust started to stick together, forming clumps that eventually formed planets and their satellites. Eventually the hot centre of the solar nebula formed a star - the Sun. <br>

<span id="content">
The Big Bang theory states that the universe was formed about 14 billion years ago as the result of a giant explosion of very dense and hot matter. This matter expanded and started to cool down, going through different transitional phases. The universe has been expanding ever since. <br><br>
The term 'universe' means all of time, space, matter and energy. It is everything that we know. The universe holds everything from the tiniest particle to the clusters of galaxies, known as super-clusters. <br><br>
The first scientist to come up with the idea of a 'big bang' was the astrophysicist Friedrich Franz Friedmann who used relativity field equations to prove that the universe is expanding. Edwin Hubble's observations later proved this theory. <br><br>
Initially the theory was called 'The primeval atom'. Today astrophysicists with a sense of humour sum up the Big Bang theory as the following: First there was nothing, then there was the bang and then there was everything.
