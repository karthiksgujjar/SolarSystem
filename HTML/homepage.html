The 'Solar System' was formed from a cloud of space dust and gas that was squeezed by a supernova explosion : <b>Big Bang theory</b>. <br>
As the nebula contracted, it spun at incredible speed, leading to frequent collisions between dust grains. Then the Gravity pulled the gas and dust together, forming a solar nebula. This solar nebula grew hotter and denser, forming a disk of gas and dust in its core. Particles of nebula dust started to stick together, forming groups that eventually formed as planets and their satellites. Eventually the hot core of the solar nebula formed a star which is known as- <b>The Sun</b>. <br>

<span id="content">
According to Big Bang theory the universe was formed about 14 billion years ago as the result of a giant explosion of very dense and hot matter. This matter expanded and started to cool down, going through different transformational phases. The universe has been expanding ever since. <br><br>
The term 'universe' means all of time, space, matter and energy. It is everything that we know. The universe holds everything from the giant stars and planets to the smallest particle in galaxies. <br><br>
The first scientist to come up with the idea of a 'big bang' was the astrophysicist <b>Friedrich Franz Friedmann</b> who used relativity field equations to prove that the universe is expanding. Later <b>Edwin Hubble's</b> observations proved that Friedrich's theory is true. <br><br>
Initially the hypothesis was called <b>'The primeval atom'</b>. Today astrophysicists with a sense of humour sum up the Big Bang theory as the following: First there was nothing, then there was the bang and then there was everything.
