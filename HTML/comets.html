            <p class="content">Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust roughly the size of a small
                town. When
                a comet's orbit brings it close to the sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing
                head
                larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the sun for millions
                of
                kilometers.</p>

            <p class="subHeading">10 Need-to-Know Things About the Comets</p>
            <ol class="content">
                <li>Comets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths - just like the planets. The path of a comet though is far
                    more
                    elliptical than that of any planet.</li>
                <li>Comets have a halo when they move close to the Sun. What happens is the solar radiation vaporizes
                    the ice
                    and gas in the comet into a halo around it.</li>
                <li>The most famous comet is <b> Halley's Comet</b>. It has been observed since at least 240 B.C. Its
                    orbit
                    makes it visible from Earth every 76 years. It was named after the British astronomer <b>Edmond
                        Halley.</b>
                </li>
                <li>Days on comets vary. One day on comet 'Halley' varies between 2.2 to 7.4 Earth days (the time it
                    takes for
                    comet Halley to rotate or spin once). Comet Halley makes a complete orbit around the sun in 76 Earth
                    years.
                </li>
                <li>Notable comets include Comet <b>Hale-Bopp</b>, which was discovered in 1995 and Comet <b>
                        Hyakutake</b>,
                    discovered in 1996.</li>
                <li>A comet warms up as it nears the sun and develops an atmosphere, or coma. The coma may be hundreds
                    of
                    thousands of kilometers in diameter.</li>
                <li>Comets do not have moons.</li>
                <li>More than 20 missions have explored comets from a variety of viewpoints.</li>
                <li>Comets may not be able to support life themselves, but they may have brought water and organic
                    compounds --
                    the building blocks of life -- through collisions with Earth and other bodies to our solar system.
                </li>
                <li>There are over <b>3,000 currently known comets</b>. Scientists believe that there be up to one
                    billion
                    comets in our solar system.</li>
