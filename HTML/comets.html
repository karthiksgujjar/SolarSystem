<span id="content">Comets are cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust roughly the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the sun for millions of kilometers.</span>

<ol>
<li>Comets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths - just like the planets. The path of a comet though is far more elliptical than that of any planet.</li>
<li>Comets have a halo when they move close to the Sun. What happens is the solar radiation vaporizes the ice and gas gas in the comet into a halo around it.</li>
<li>Days on comets vary. One day on comet <b>'Halley'</b> varies between 2.2 to 7.4 Earth days (the time it takes for comet Halley to rotate or spin once). Comet <b> Halley</b> makes a complete orbit around the sun in 76 Earth years.</li>
<li>Notable comets include Comet <b>Hale-Bopp</b>, which was discovered in 1995 and Comet <b> Hyakutake</b>, discovered in 1996.</li>
<li>A comet warms up as it nears the sun and develops an atmosphere, or coma. The coma may be hundreds of thousands of kilometers in diameter.</li>
<li>Comets do not have moons.</li>
<li>The most famous comet is <b> Halley's Comet</b>. It has been observed since at least 240 B.C. Its orbit makes it visible from Earth every 76 years. It was named after the British astronomer <b>Edmond Halley.</b></li>
<li>More than 20 missions have explored comets from a variety of viewpoints.</li>
<li>Comets may not be able to support life themselves, but they may have brought water and organic compounds -- the building blocks of life -- through collisions with Earth and other bodies to our solar system.</li>
<li>There are over 3,000 currently known comets. Scientists believe that there be up to one billion comets in our solar system.</li>
