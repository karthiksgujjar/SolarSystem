            <p class="content">Dwarf planets are round and orbit the Sun just like the eight major planets. But unlike
                planets,
                dwarf planets are not able to clear their orbital path so there are similar objects at roughly the same
                distance
                from the Sun. A dwarf planet is much smaller than a planet (smaller even than Earth's moon), but it is
                not a
                moon. Pluto is the well known among dwarf planets.</p>

            <p class="subHeading">10 Need-to-Know Things About the Dwarf Planets</p>
            <ol class="content">
                <li>Dwarf planets are different from planets because they have not cleared their orbital paths. Planets
                    have
                    enough gravity to push other smaller objects, but dwarf planets do not.</li>
                <li>There are currently only five official dwarf planets namely, <b> Ceres</b>, <b>Pluto</b>, <b>
                        Haumea</b>,
                    <b> Makemake</b>, and <b> Eris</b>. However, there are many other dwarf planet candidates like
                    <b>Gonggong</b>, <b>Orcus</b>, <b>Quaoar</b>, <b>Sedna</b>, and <b>Salacia</b>.
                </li>
                <li>Days and years vary on dwarf planets. One day on Ceres, for example, takes about nine hours (the
                    time it
                    takes for <b> Ceres</b> to rotate or spin once). Ceres makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year
                    in
                    Ceresian time) in about 4.60 Earth years.</li>
                <li>Dwarf planets are solid rocky and icy bodies. The amount of rock vs. ice depends on their location
                    in the
                    solar system.</li>
                <li>Many, but not all dwarf planets have moons.</li>
                <li>Dwarf planets can also have ring systems. The <b>Oddball</b>,<b> Haumea</b>, has a ring surrounding
                    it. It
                    is the first object beyond Neptune's orbit known to have a ring system.</li>
                <li>Dwarf planets Pluto and Eris, for example, have thin atmospheres that expand when they come closer
                    to the
                    sun and collapse as they move farther away.</li>
                <li>The first mission to a dwarf planet was 'Dawn' which is sent to dwarf planet called Ceres. </li>
                <li>Dwarf planets cannot support life due to their atmosphere and geographical factors.</li>
                <li>Pluto was considered a planet until 2006. The discovery of similar-sized planets deeper in the
                    distant
                    Kuiper Belt sparked a debate that resulted in a new official definition of a planet that did not
                    include
                    Pluto.</li>
