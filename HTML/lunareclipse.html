            <p class="content">Lunar eclipse happens when Earth aligns between the Sun and the Moon and blocks the Sun's
                rays
                from directly reaching the Moon. The Moon does not have its own light. It shines because its surface
                reflects
                the Sun's rays. A lunar eclipse only happens during a full moon and can last as long as six hours,
                according to
                the European Space Agency (ESA).</p>

            <p class="content">There are three types of lunar eclipses depending on how the sun, Earth and moon are aligned at the time of the eclipse.</p>
            <ol class="content">
                <li>
                    <b>Total lunar eclipse</b> takes place when the
                    Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon and its shadow covers the Moon. Eclipse watchers can see
                    the Moon
                    turn red when the eclipse reaches totality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Partial lunar eclipse</b> happens when the
                    Earth moves between the Sun and the Full Moon, but they are not precisely aligned. Only part of the
                    Moon's
                    visible surface moves into the dark part of the Earth's shadow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Penumbral lunar eclipse</b> takes place when
                    the Moon moves through the faint, outer part of Earth's shadow, the penumbra. This type of eclipse
                    is not as
                    dramatic as other types of lunar eclipses and is often mistaken for a regular Full Moon.
