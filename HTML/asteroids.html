            <p class="content">Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the sun, but are too small to be called
                planets.
                Tens of thousands of these minor planets are gathered in the main asteroid belt, a vast doughnut-shaped
                ring
                between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids that pass close to Earth are called near-earth
                objects.</p>

            <p class="subHeading">10 Need-to-Know Things About the Asteroids:</p>
            <ol class="content">
                <li>If all of the asteroids were combined into a ball, they would still be much smaller than Earth's
                    moon.
                    The
                    average distance between the asteroids would be about 100,000 miles. </li>
                <li>Most Asteroids orbit our sun or any other star in a empty space between the Mars and Jupiter orbit,
                    which is
                    known as the <b>Asteroid Belt</b>.</li>
                <li>Days and years vary by asteroid. A day on asteroid <b>Ida</b>, for example, it takes only 4.6 hours
                    (the
                    time it takes to rotate or spin once). <b> Ida </b> makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in
                    this
                    asteroid's time) in 4.8 Earth years.</li>
                <li>Asteroids are solid, rocky and irregular bodies.</li>
                <li>Asteroids do not have atmospheres.</li>
                <li>More than 150 asteroids are known to have their own moon like companion (some have multiple). The
                    first
                    discovery of an asteroid-moon system was <b> Ida </b> and its moon 'Dactyl' in 1993.</li>
                <li>One asteroid named <b> Chariklo </b> is known to have two dense and narrow rings.</li>
                <li>More than 10 spacecraft have explored asteroids. 'NEAR Shoemaker' spacecraft was even landed on an
                    asteroid
                    called Eros. The 'Dawn mission' is the first mission to orbit a main belt asteroid called Vesta in
                    2011.
                </li>
                <li>Asteroids cannot support life as we know it.</li>
                <li>'Ceres' is the first and largest asteroid to be discovered (1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi) and it is the
                    closest
                    dwarf planet to the sun, enclosed over one-third of the estimated total mass of all the asteroids in
                    the
                    asteroid belt.</li>
