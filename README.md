# SolarSystem
A static website where we showcase some useful information about about our Solar System in the Milky Way Galaxy. 
This is also a to be submitted mini project.
This website is intended to provide only essential information and does not cover any vast data that may be redundant for some people.
We are trying to make this website as joyful and easy to understand about the Planets and Stars of our Solar System.
