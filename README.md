# Solar System Mini Project
*A static website where we showcase some useful information about about our Solar System in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

* This is also a mini project submitted to the Tumkur University in the academic year 2022-23 by 4th Sem students(Details given in **Contact Us** page) of Dept. of BCA Government First Grade College, Tumkur.

* This website is intended to provide only essential information and does not cover any vast data that may be redundant for some people.

* We tried really hard to make this website as joyful and easy to understand about the Planets and Stars of our Solar System.

* Later this mini project got revamped by me.
  * Changed the layout of the pages using grid and flexbox.
  * Added semantic tags to the site
  * Added reponsive images in the site.
 
* Website is hosted at https://karthiksgujjar.github.io/SolarSystem/
